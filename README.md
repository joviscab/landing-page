# Second Odin Project - Landing Page

## Who am I? What is this?

Hello, my name is Joviscab and this is part of my learning to code journey!

This is the second project called Landing Page, that is part of the Foundations Course of The Odin Project. The idea of this project is to put to practice all the CCS and Flexbox knowledge that I have acquired until now. In this project I am going to build a website, following the instructions of Odin's lesson! The website will consist in a single page with basic elements.

## Skills

With this project my idea is to check the CSS and Flexbox skills that I have learned until now, as well as using it as an exercise to remember all the lessons until this point.
